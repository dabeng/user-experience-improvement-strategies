# User Experience Improvement Strategies
There are no jQuery plugins, Angular directives, React components or Polymer elements in here. We just share feasible ways or best practices to improve user experience with native javascript.
Of course, if you want, you can build any plugins or components based on these improvement strategies.

### Do not make a distraction when user is doing a series of operation.

### Make full use of keys -- Tab, Shift, ↑, ↓, ←, etc.

### Provide progress bar, loading spinner or any visible tips for long-running operations.

### Do not overuse modals.

### Anytime, the screenshot of your application should be unnderstood unambiguously. 

### Do not overuse scrollbars.
* Anytime, do not keep more than 3 parallel horizontal scrollbars in the full browser width view.
* Do not nest div with scrollbars.

### Anytime, we just provide users with only one edit status.

### Replace the abrupt alerts with customized warnning messages.

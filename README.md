# User Experience Improvement Strategies
The key points are not jQuery plugins, Angular directives, React components or Polymer elements in here. We just share feasible solutions, reasonable thoughts and friendly reminders to improve user experience with the help of javascript.
##Ⅰ. What elements do you think an excellent User Experience of web apps should possess?

## Ⅱ. We got the following main direction of attack on hand.
 
## Ⅲ. Acculated  tips or tricks.

### 1. Coding

#### Do not overuse UI libraries.

#### Do not mix up UI libraries as far as possible.

### 2. Layout

#### Do not make interface shake.

**Anytime, we just provide users with only one edit status**

**Anytime, the screenshot of your application should be unnderstood unambiguously.**

**Do not overuse modals.**

**Do not overuse scrollbars.**
* Anytime, do not keep more than 3 parallel horizontal scrollbars in the full browser width view.
* Do not nest divs with scrollbar.

**When you got a long scrollbar, you need to think about which elements should be kept fixed(e.g. navigation bar)and which elements should be hidden.**

**For comments or logs section, appropriate identation is necessary.**

### 3. Usability and Friendliness

**Make full use of keys -- Tab, Shift, ↑, ↓, ←, etc.**

**Provide progress bar, loading spinner or any visible tips for long-running operations.**

**For division or classification tasks, drag-drop operation is a good choice.**

**Avoid making a distraction when user is doing a series of operation.**

**Do not overuse pagination, maybe the filter + dynamic loading is engouh.**

**Replace the abrupt alerts with customized warnning messages.**

### 4. Animation

**CSS animations are always preferred than JS animations.**

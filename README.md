# User Experience Improvement Strategies
The key points are not jQuery plugins, Angular directives, React components or Polymer elements in here. We just share feasible solutions, reasonable thoughts and friendly reminders to improve user experience with the help of javascript.

### Avoid making a distraction when user is doing a series of operation.

### Do not make interface shake.

### Make full use of keys -- Tab, Shift, ↑, ↓, ←, etc.

### Provide progress bar, loading spinner or any visible tips for long-running operations.

### Do not overuse modals.

### Anytime, the screenshot of your application should be unnderstood unambiguously. 

### Do not overuse scrollbars.
* Anytime, do not keep more than 3 parallel horizontal scrollbars in the full browser width view.
* Do not nest divs with scrollbar.

### Anytime, we just provide users with only one edit status.

### Replace the abrupt alerts with customized warnning messages.

### Do not overuse UI libraries.

### Do not overuse pagination, maybe the filter + dynamic loading is engouh.

### CSS animations are always preferred than JS animations.

### For comments or logs section, appropriate identation is necessary.

### For division or classification tasks, drag-drop operation is a good choice.

### When you got a long scrollbar, you need to think about which elements should be kept fixed(e.g. navigation bar)and which elements should be hidden.
